# 23cm-45W-PA
This repository contains details of the G4BAO 45Watt 23cm Power Amplifier published in RSGB RadCom Magazine in June 2009 and later in the book " Microwave Know How for the Radio Amateur" by Andy Barter, G8ATD

This PA was sold for many years as a kit by the designer. The decision has been made to not sell any further kits so the designs are now made avaialable here under the terms of an MIT licence. 
It includes a copy of the original article, Eagle board and schematic files, plus Gerber files for the PCB, which must be made from  Taconic 0.7mm RF35 substrate.
